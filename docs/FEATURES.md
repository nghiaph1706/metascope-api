# Features — MetaScope API

List of features, in priority order. Check `[x]` when complete.

## Core Infrastructure

- [x] Docker Compose stack runs (API + Postgres + Redis + Celery)

## Data Collection

- [x] Riot API client (`riot_client.py`)
  - Token bucket rate limiter (20 req/s, 100 req/2min)
  - asyncio.Semaphore for concurrent limit
  - Retry with exponential backoff on 429
- [x] Transformer: parse Riot JSON → DB models

## Meta & Analytics

- [x] Stats calculation service (champion, item, augment stats)

## Compositions

- [ ] Comp detection algorithm (trait-based fingerprinting from match data)

## Items

- [ ] `GET /meta/items/cheatsheet` — craft table: component A + B = item X
- [ ] `GET /meta/items/{id}/best-holders` — top champions using this item most effectively

## Game Data (Static)

- [ ] `GET /game/rolling-odds` — shop odds by level (seeded from Riot static data)

- [x] `GET /game/items` — list of items with recipes
- [x] `GET /game/augments` — list of augments by tier
- [x] `GET /game/traits` — list of traits with breakpoints
- [x] Auto-update on new patch (Celery task checks DataDragon)
- [x] `GET /game/items/cheatsheet` — craft table (component A + B = item X)

- [ ] Markdown support for guide content
- [ ] Filter guides by patch, comp, author

## Patch Notes

- [ ] `GET /patches` — list of patches
- [ ] `GET /patches/{patch}/notes` — summarized patch notes
- [ ] `POST /patches/{patch}/notes` — admin creates/updates patch notes
- [ ] Structured format: buffs, nerfs, new champions, reworks, item changes
- [ ] Auto-detect champion stat changes via data (compare win rate pre/post patch)
- [ ] "TL;DR" section — summary of the 3-5 most important points

## Post-Game Analysis — "What Went Wrong?"

- [ ] Analysis engine: compare comp/items/level with winner + meta
- [ ] Issue detection rules (weak comp, bad items, contested, late level...)
- [ ] Bilingual messages (VI + EN)
- [ ] `GET /player/{puuid}/matches/{match_id}/analysis` — analyze a single match
